Hash House Hazards
==================

A basic website for a running club in Malaysia called Hash House Hazards P.J. It is 
a personal project given by one of the members of the club to simply revamp and redesign 
the site. 

Before
------

- Unorganized HTML coding
- In-line CSS styling
- Unattractive for viewing

After
-----

- Improved HTML coding
- Implementation of PHP
- Implementation of CSS
- Implementation of JS

Redesigning
-----------

A few elements have been taught of into the redesigning process of the website. Some of it includes
[Bootstrap][], [Codeigniter][], and [FlatUI][]. On top of that, coding will be organized by seperating 
*CSS* under `../assets/css`, *images* under `../assets/images` and finally *JS* under `../assets/js`.

[Bootstrap]: http://getbootstrap.com/ "Bootstrap 3.0"
